# AllLife-Bank-Loan-Prediction-Model
Data Science project using Decision Tree classifier
- by: _Gbenga Olaolorun_

## Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether liability customers of AllLife Bank will buy personal loans. The model will help the marketing department to identify potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing a loan, understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving purchases, and identify which segment of customers to target more.

## Background and Context
AllLife Bank is a US-based bank with a growing customer base. While most customers are depositors, the bank is looking to expand its borrower base to increase loan business and earn more through interest on loans. A previous campaign had a 9% success rate in converting liability customers to personal loan customers. This project aims to build on that success with better-targeted marketing.

## Data
The dataset includes various attributes of the customers, such as age, income, family size, education level, and others. The goal is to use this data to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offered by the bank.
